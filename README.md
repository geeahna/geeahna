- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gianna
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analytics. Currently starting with R, going to try Python next. At some point, I think it would be fun to learn how to make some simple games too. 
- ðŸŒ± I studied CS in college for three and a half years, and then dropped the major at the last second. There was just something that didn't click for me, I'm really hoping I can work past that roadblock this time. I think I had trouble bridging the gap between data structures and applying it to actual coding. 
- ðŸ“« im gee_ahna on discord! I love to join communities!
