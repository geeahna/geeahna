- 👋 Hi, I’m Gianna
- 👀 I’m currently learning Python. I don't have a set goal in mind yet. At some point, I think it would be fun to learn how to make some simple games but I'm seeing where my programming takes me. 
- 🌱 I studied CS in college for three and a half years, and then dropped the major at the last second. There was just something that didn't click for me, I'm really hoping I can work past that roadblock this time. I think I had trouble bridging the gap between data structures and applying it to actual coding. 
- 📫 im gee_ahna on discord! I love to join communities!
